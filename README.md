# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

A Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The shape options are Triangle, Circle, & Rectangle. You can enter a maximum of 3 characters to add to your logo and choose a background color of red, blue, or black.

- I learned how you can build things and print them without using HTML. How to structure the command line to allow user input and it write it to an acceptable file.
- I faced some challenges with logic and adding to much different code structures which ultimately confused me. I used Google, my instructor, and a classmate for assistance. I was unable to figure out the error on the triangle.  I also face difficulties knowing how to arrange the sies so the text would display properly.
- I can see how assignment would be helpful in the workforce
